# Shikshak

Shikshak is a Product (camera device collaborated with an app) which with the help of face recognition can keep the speaker(in motion) in the center of the frame. At the same time it can convert the audio collected into a transcript along with timestamp of the video of the entire verbal delivery which is then shortened into a summary using neural network for easy reference. The device is collaborated with an app to store all the verbal deliveries which can be classified, downloaded and bookmarked.

Huge potential in the education sector where lectures can be stored in video form along with a transcript and auto generated summary which can be used as notes for lectures by students.
